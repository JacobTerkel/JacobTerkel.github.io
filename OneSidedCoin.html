  <h4>A One Sided Coin</h4>
<p><i>This Essay is a revised version of my argumentative research paper for my English 101 class. I was very happy with how it turned out, so I decided to revise it slightly and post it to my blog, I hope you find it interesting, informative, and maybe even enlightening. In addition, I also added a single paragraph, not part of this essay, but very pertinent to the topic, about the now-defunct 1776 commission. </i></p>

<p>After the Second World War came to a close and Germany surrendered, thirteen trials were held against Nazi party officials for “crimes against peace and crimes against humanity” in Nuremberg This was something new for the world, as every trial that had been conducted for war crimes beforehand had been in accordance with a national court, not an international one(Nuremberg). These trials were very important for the world as it made genocide and other inhumane acts punishable by international court. So, if any country were to ever attempt such things in the future, the nations of the world would surely punish them. But that isn’t always the case. Especially for the more powerful countries. When a country is as powerful as China or The United States, it is hard to check their military authority. This can lead to America breaching the international code set in place all these years ago without punishment, and it happens far too often. Furthermore, because America is such a patriotic country, its long history of war and interventionism in other countries, as well as our own, is a relatively unspoken topic in American mainstream media. This lack of discourse and discussion regarding the topic of American wrongdoings in schools and in general debate is only harmful and destructive to the people of America. </p>
